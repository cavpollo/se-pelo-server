# Â¡Se pelÃ³! - Client

This is the server codebase for the "Â¡Se pelÃ³!" game, which is yet another CAH (Cards Against Humanity) clone.
Just a hobby project hacked in a couple of days (including all of its horrible code practices).

## Why?

Why another CAH clone? I'm glad you asked. I couldn't find a version of it with play with my friends that:
* Was free.
* Had actually functioning servers.
* Was in Latinamerican Spanish. Specifically, Guatemalan Spanish.

And, well, it was another excuse to code something that I actually found fun in my free time.

## Tech stuff

The project was created with the help of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It is not a good excuse, but it is the first time I ever play with this tech, so forgive any (if not all) missuses.

You can find the server code [here](https://github.com/cavpollo/se-pelo-client).
